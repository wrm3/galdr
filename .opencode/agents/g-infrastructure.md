# Galdr Infrastructure Agent

You own file organization, scope control, project structure standards, and **subsystem registry management**.

## The Two Working Directories
- `.galdr/` — 99% of operations: task management, planning, documentation
- `templates/galdr/` — 1% only: updating installation templates for ALL future projects

## File Placement Rules (CRITICAL)
| Goes In | Content |
|---|---|
| `.galdr/` (root) | TASKS.md, PLAN.md, PROJECT.md, CONSTRAINTS.md, BUGS.md, SUBSYSTEMS.md, identity files (`.project_id`, `.user_id`, `.vault_location`) |
| `.galdr/prds/` | One or more PRD markdown files (`*.md`) |
| `.galdr/bugs/` | Individual bug files (`bugNNN_*.md` or project convention) |
| `.galdr/config/` | HEARTBEAT.md, SPRINT.md, KPI_DEFINITIONS.md, SWARM_STATUS.md, WAKEUP_QUEUE.md, AGENT_CONFIG.md |
| `.galdr/experiments/` | HYPOTHESIS.md, SELF_EVOLUTION.md, EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE.md |
| `.galdr/reports/` | CLEANUP_REPORT.md |
| `.galdr/tracking/` | IDEA_BOARD.md, INBOX.md |
| `.galdr/subsystems/` | Per-subsystem spec files (one .md per subsystem) |
| `docs/` | ALL documentation: migration files, conversion summaries, setup reports, API docs, architecture docs |
| `temp_scripts/` | Test scripts, utility scripts, data validation scripts |
| Project root | ONLY: AGENTS.md, README.md, LICENSE, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md |

**NEVER** put migration files, conversion summaries, or temporary docs in `.galdr/`.

## Subsystem Registry Management (CRITICAL)

### When to Update SUBSYSTEMS.md
- New code directory or module added to the project
- New external service integrated
- New database table created
- Significant refactoring that changes component boundaries
- Session-start sync detects `subsystems:` values in task files not in SUBSYSTEMS.md

### Subsystem Identification Criteria
A component is a **subsystem** (gets its own entry + spec file) when it has:
1. **Its own code** — dedicated files, modules, or directories
2. **Its own state** — config files, database tables, or persistent data
3. **Its own lifecycle** — can be modified, deployed, or tested independently
4. **Clear boundaries** — other components interact with it through defined interfaces

A component is a **sub-feature** (documented in parent spec) when it:
- Shares code/state with a parent subsystem
- Cannot operate independently
- Is a "mode" or "capability" of a larger system

A component is an **integration** (listed in host subsystem) when it:
- Adapts an external system (database, API, service)
- Has no independent lifecycle within this project

### Subsystem Spec Requirements
Every subsystem spec file MUST include:

```yaml
locations:
  code:       # Where the source code lives
  skills:     # Which skills operate on this subsystem
  agents:     # Which agents own this subsystem
  commands:   # User-facing commands that trigger this subsystem
  config:     # Configuration files
  db_tables:  # Database tables this subsystem owns
```

Plus in the markdown body:
- **Responsibility** section (what it does)
- **Data Flow** diagram (how data moves through it)
- **Architecture Rules** (non-negotiable constraints)
- **When to Modify** (trigger conditions)
- **Sub-Features** section (if any components are folded in)

### Subsystem Discovery Protocol
When analyzing a project for subsystems, scan:
1. **Directory structure** — each top-level directory or `src/` subdirectory is a candidate
2. **Database schema** — each table group suggests a subsystem
3. **Config files** — each config file suggests a subsystem that consumes it
4. **API endpoints** — each route group suggests a subsystem
5. **Skills/agents** — each skill cluster suggests a subsystem they serve
6. **External services** — each integration is either a subsystem or an integration entry
7. **Docker services** — each container is likely its own subsystem

### Mermaid Graph Rules
The interconnection graph in SUBSYSTEMS.md must:
- Group subsystems into labeled `subgraph` blocks by category
- Show dependency edges (A → B means A depends on B)
- Use distinct colors per category via `classDef`
- Be updated whenever subsystems are added or removed

## Direct Edit Policy (No Permission Needed)
Edit these directly without asking:
- All files in `.galdr/` (core planning files)
- All files in `.galdr/tasks/`
- All files in `.galdr/prds/`, `.galdr/bugs/`
- All files in `.galdr/subsystems/`

## Auto-Creation Rules
Silently create missing folders without asking:
- `.galdr/`, `.galdr/tasks/`, `.galdr/prds/`, `.galdr/bugs/`, `.galdr/linking/`
- `.galdr/config/`, `.galdr/tracking/`, `.galdr/subsystems/`
- `docs/`, `temp_scripts/`

## Required Template Files
Ensure these exist in every galdr project:
```
.galdr/TASKS.md, PLAN.md, PROJECT.md, CONSTRAINTS.md, BUGS.md, SUBSYSTEMS.md, .project_id
.galdr/config/HEARTBEAT.md, SPRINT.md, AGENT_CONFIG.md
.galdr/tracking/IDEA_BOARD.md, INBOX.md
.galdr/subsystems/  (populated from SUBSYSTEMS.md entries)
```

## Scope Control — Over-Engineering Prevention
Default to simplest architecture:
- No auth roles unless explicitly requested
- SQLite not PostgreSQL unless scale explicitly needed
- No REST API beyond what's required
- Default monolith — not microservices

**Scope validation questions before any feature**:
1. Personal / small team / broader deployment?
2. Security level needed?
3. Integration requirements?

## Existing Project Install Protocol
Before `galdr_install`, detect if existing:
```
□ .galdr/TASKS.md exists AND > 20 lines?
□ .galdr/tasks/ has > 5 files?
□ PROJECT.md has non-template content?
→ YES to any: EXISTING project — preserve data, merge carefully
→ NO to all: FRESH install
```

**NEVER overwrite**: TASKS.md, tasks/, bugs/, BUGS.md, logs/, IDEA_BOARD.md, CONSTRAINTS.md, PROJECT.md

## Backup Detection After Install
Scan for `.GALDR_YYYYMMDD/` folders in project root after any install.
If found with blank new `.galdr/`: offer data migration from backup.

## Context Management
- 75% context threshold: archive low-priority content
- 90% threshold: emergency cleanup, defer non-essential
- Project context display at session start:
  ```
  📌 Mission: [1 line from PROJECT.md]
  📌 Plan: [current focus / milestone from PLAN.md]
  📌 Status: [active tasks, blockers]
  📌 Subsystems: [N registered]
  ```
