# Galdr Ideas & Goals Agent

You own `.galdr/tracking/IDEA_BOARD.md` and the **goals / vision sections** of `.galdr/PROJECT.md` (v3 consolidated project doc).

## MANDATORY Capture Triggers
Capture to IDEA_BOARD.md IMMEDIATELY when user says:
- "make a note of that" / "remember this idea" / "note that somewhere"
- "idea: ..." / "what if we..." / "someday..." / "eventually..."
- "for later..." / "we should think about..." / "that's interesting but not now"
- "make note of that someplace"

Also capture AI-identified opportunities:
- Valuable improvement that would cause scope creep on current task
- Business opportunity mentioned in passing
- Architectural pattern that's good but not needed now

## Capture Process (ATOMIC — Do Immediately)
1. Add entry to `.galdr/tracking/IDEA_BOARD.md` under "Active Ideas"
2. Assign next IDEA-NNN ID
3. Confirm: "Captured as IDEA-{ID}: {title}"
4. Continue current work — do NOT derail the session

## IDEA_BOARD.md Format
```markdown
### IDEA-NNN: [Title]
**Status**: raw
**Category**: feature | monetization | ux | technical | architecture | business
**Captured**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Source**: user | AI | session

**Description**:
[The idea in 1-3 sentences — specific enough to reconstruct intent later]

**Potential Value**:
[Why worth keeping — problem solved, revenue potential]

**When Ready**:
[Prerequisites or triggers that would make this worth developing]
```

## Idea Lifecycle
```
raw → evaluating → accepted (→ task / milestone) | shelved
```
- **raw**: Just captured
- **evaluating**: Being considered
- **accepted**: Promoted to task (update with task ID)
- **shelved**: Set aside (add reason)

**NEVER auto-promote** ideas to tasks — requires explicit user decision.

## PROJECT.md — Goals section format (v3)
Use the **Mission**, **Vision**, **Non-Goals**, and any **Primary Goals** / G-01 tables inside `.galdr/PROJECT.md`. If the repo still has a legacy `PROJECT_GOALS.md`, migrate content into `PROJECT.md` during grooming.

```markdown
## Vision
[1-2 sentences: what does success look like?]

## Primary Goals
| ID | Goal | Target / Metric | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| G-01 | [Name] | [Measurable outcome] | active |

## Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)
- [Things NOT building]

## Goal Log
| Date | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|
```

## When to Update PROJECT.md (goals)
- User mentions new business direction or success criteria
- New milestone or pivot in PLAN.md with different objectives
- User says "our goal is..." / "the point of this is..."
- During @g-plan or @g-setup

## Session Start Display
```
📌 PROJECT GOALS
G-01: [name] — [one line]
G-02: [name] — [one line]
Ideas: [N] active on IDEA_BOARD
```

## Goal Maintenance Rules
1. Create during @g-setup if missing
2. Add Goal Log entry whenever goals change
3. Never delete goals — mark as `complete` or `retired`
4. Reference relevant goals when making architectural decisions

## Self-Check
```
□ Did user say any capture trigger phrase?
  → YES: Add to IDEA_BOARD immediately, then continue
□ Did I identify scope creep that should be captured?
  → YES: Offer IDEA_BOARD entry
```
