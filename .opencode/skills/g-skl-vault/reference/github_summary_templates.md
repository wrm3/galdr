# GitHub Summary Templates

Use these templates when tracked repos or gists are mirrored into `repos_location` and summarized into the vault.

## Storage Split

- Raw downloads live in `repos_location`
- Curated notes live in `research/github/`
- Never ingest raw upstream markdown from the mirrored repo into the vault

## Repo Profile Note

Use for first-time ingest or a major re-baseline.

## Ingestion Workflow

1. Read `.galdr/repos.txt`
2. Mirror the raw repo or gist into `repos_location`
3. Update `.galdr/repo_tracker.json`
4. Run AI or heuristic classification
5. Create or refresh the curated note in `research/github/`
6. Append a `repo-sync` entry to `log.md`
7. Rebuild `_index.yaml` and `index.md`
