name: galdr-project
description: Use for all project-level concerns — initializing .galdr/ in a new project, grooming existing .galdr/ files, filling template placeholders, healing sync issues, creating or updating PLAN.md, writing PRDs, defining subsystems, managing CONSTRAINTS.md, and project planning. Activate on "set up galdr", "groom galdr", "fix galdr files", "create a plan", "write a PRD", "define requirements", "project is out of sync", or any planning/structure request.

# galdr-project

Owns `.galdr/PROJECT.md`, `.galdr/PLAN.md`, `.galdr/prds/`, `.galdr/SUBSYSTEMS.md`, `.galdr/CONSTRAINTS.md`, and `.galdr/.identity`.

Three modes: **INITIALIZE** (new project), **GROOM** (fix existing), **PLAN** (planning and PRD work).

---

## Mode Detection

```
□ Does .galdr/ have 5+ real (non-template) files?
→ NO:  INITIALIZE mode
→ YES: Does the request involve PRD, plan, subsystems, or constraints?
  → YES: PLAN mode
  → NO:  GROOM mode
```

---

## INITIALIZE Mode

### Step 1: Analyze Project
Scan before creating anything:
- Directory structure, tech stack, README, existing todo files
- Is this monorepo or single project?
- Identifiable subsystems from folder names?

Ask 4 questions if not obvious:
1. What is the main goal or mission?
2. Who are the primary users?
3. What are the key features or components?
4. Any known milestones or deadlines?

### Step 2: Create Folder Structure
```
.galdr/tasks/   .galdr/prds/   .galdr/bugs/   .galdr/subsystems/
.galdr/reports/ docs/          temp_scripts/
```

### Step 3: Generate ALL Files (Never Leave Placeholders)
Generate with REAL content from project analysis. Never output `{project_name}` or `[Brief mission]` unfilled.

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Vision, Mission, Goals (plain language — no jargon), Non-Goals, project linking |
| `PLAN.md` | Strategy, milestones, sequencing |
| `CONSTRAINTS.md` | Blank constraints table |
| `TASKS.md` | Sequential task list |
| `BUGS.md` | Empty index |
| `SUBSYSTEMS.md` | Auto-detected subsystems from folder structure |
| `IDEA_BOARD.md` | Blank template |
| `.identity` | `project_id` (new UUID), `project_name`, `galdr_version`, `user_id=unknown` |

Generate `.project_id` UUID: `python -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"`

### Step 4: Create Setup Task
`task001_GALDR_initialization.md` — `status: completed`, `retroactive: true`

### Step 5: Print Initialization Report
Show: structure created, subsystems detected, Goals written, next steps.

---

## GROOM Mode

Run checks in order. Auto-fix where safe. Collect unknowns and ask once at end.

### G-1: Placeholder Audit
Scan all `.galdr/*.md` for unfilled patterns:
`{project_name}`, `{Goal name}`, `{subsystem-name-1}`, `YYYY-MM-DD` (literal)
→ Fill from `.identity` / `PLAN.md` where possible; flag unknowns for user

### G-2: .identity Check
Missing or invalid UUID → generate: `python -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"`

### G-3: TASKS.md ↔ tasks/ Sync
- Every active status entry: check `tasks/task{id}_*.md` exists
- Orphans (file, no entry): offer to add or delete
- Phantoms (entry, no file): offer retroactive stub or remove
- Status mismatch: task file is source of truth — fix TASKS.md

### G-4: PLAN.md / PRD / CONSTRAINTS Sync
- `PLAN.md` exists and is non-placeholder
- `prds/` has at least one PRD for delivery-type projects
- `CONSTRAINTS.md` exists

### G-5: YAML Frontmatter Validation
Required: `id, title, status, priority`
→ Add missing fields with defaults

### G-6: PROJECT.md Health
Goals section missing or has placeholder text → regenerate from vision/mission

### G-7: SUBSYSTEMS.md Staleness
Collect `subsystems:` values from task files → compare to SUBSYSTEMS.md → add missing stubs

### G-8: Orphaned Files Cleanup
- `bugs/*.md` files not listed in `BUGS.md` → flag
- Unknown `.md` files in `.galdr/` root → flag
- `temp_scripts/` contents → flag for review

### G-9: Grooming Report
```
═══════════════════════════════════
GALDR GROOMING REPORT — {date}
═══════════════════════════════════
✅ .identity: valid
✅ TASKS.md ↔ task files: 12/12 synced
⚠️  Placeholders filled: 3 in PROJECT.md
⚠️  YAML upgraded: 2 files
❌ PLAN.md: incomplete — fixed

ACTIONS TAKEN: [list]

## PLAN Mode

### Project Types
| Type | Key Files |
|------|-----------|
| `delivery` | `prds/*.md` — one or more named PRD files |
| `research` | `PLAN.md` with hypothesis sections |

### PRD Structure (`.galdr/prds/*.md`)
Each PRD is its own file (e.g. `prd_main.md`, `prd_api.md`):
1. Overview
2. Goals (business goals / user goals / non-goals)
3. User personas
4. Milestones (high-level — execution detail lives in `TASKS.md`)
5. UX considerations
6. Narrative
7. Success metrics
8. Technical considerations (subsystems, shared modules)
9. Delivery checkpoints
10. User stories with acceptance criteria

> **Section 8.6 — Shared Modules**: Identify shared logic BEFORE feature work starts.
> "Auth token parsing shared across API/middleware/SSR → extract to `lib/services/auth.ts`"

### PLAN.md (master strategy)
Holds sequencing, milestones, and pivot history — not phase-based task ID ranges. Tasks use sequential IDs; link milestones to task IDs in prose or tables.

### CONSTRAINTS.md
Constraints CANNOT be overridden by any task or agent.
```markdown
### C-001: [Name]
**Status**: active
**Rationale**: [Why this exists]
**Constraint**: [What is forbidden/required]
**Enforcement**: [How violations are detected]
```

### Scope Validation (Ask Before Any PRD / Plan Update)
1. Personal use / small team / broader deployment?
2. Security: minimal / standard / enhanced / enterprise?
3. Scalability expectations?
4. Integration needs?
5. Feature complexity preference?

> **Over-engineering prevention**: Default monolith. No auth roles unless requested. SQLite not PostgreSQL unless explicitly needed.

### Subsystems Registry (`.galdr/SUBSYSTEMS.md`)
Each subsystem: ID (SS-NN), Name, Type (core/support/integration), Status, Purpose, Key Components, Dependencies, Interfaces.

## Error Handling

If `.galdr/` already exists with real content during INITIALIZE:
→ Ask: **Skip** (keep existing) / **Merge** (add missing files only) / **Reset** (backup + recreate — DESTRUCTIVE)
