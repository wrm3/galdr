# g-medic

**Replaces**: `g-medic` (deprecated — delegates to `g-medic`)

**Files Touched**: `.galdr/` (all files and folders), optionally linked project folders at L4

**Authorization rule**: `g-medic` and `g-setup` are the ONLY things that may write `galdr_version` to `.galdr/.identity`. No other skill, agent, hook, or command may touch that field.

---

## Command Interface

```bash
@g-medic                      # L1 triage only (safe default, always applies)
@g-medic --level 2            # L1 + L2 (report generated; --apply to execute fixes)
@g-medic --level 3            # L1 + L2 + L3 (requires --apply to write fixes)
@g-medic --level 4            # L1 + L2 + L3 + L4 (requires PCAC topology)
@g-medic --ecosystem          # alias for --level 4
@g-medic --dry-run            # any level: report only, no writes
@g-medic --level 2 --apply   # apply L2 fixes after generating report
```

**Default behavior**: `@g-medic` with no args runs L1 only (auto-applies — it's always safe).

---

## Mode Detection (Run Before Any Level)

Read `.galdr/.identity`. Based on what you find, select a mode:

```
□ .identity missing entirely?
  → STOP. Invoke g-setup. This is not a repair situation — it's a fresh install.

□ galdr_version in .identity doesn't match the current galdr version?
  → MODE: UPGRADE (full structural migration, then continue through all phases)

□ galdr_version matches, but files/folders are missing or corrupted?
  → MODE: REPAIR (structural fixes + per-file health, skip version bump)

□ galdr_version matches, structure is intact, just routine maintenance?
  → MODE: MAINTAIN (TTL resets, health score, backlog — skip structural phases)
```

Report selected mode at the start:
```
🩺 g-medic — L{N} | MODE: {UPGRADE | REPAIR | MAINTAIN}
   Project: {project_name} | galdr v{current} → v{target or "current"}
   Dry-run: YES (pass --apply to execute) | APPLY
```

---

## Level 1 — Triage (Structural Integrity)

*Safe to run any time. Fully autonomous. Blast radius: files and folders only.*
*Applied automatically with no `--apply` needed. Runs in all modes.*

### L1-A: Folder Structure

Verify every required `.galdr/` folder exists. Create missing ones silently:

```
tasks/            individual task files
bugs/             individual bug files
features/         PRD/feature files
subsystems/       per-subsystem spec files
reports/          cleanup and upgrade reports
specifications_collection/   incoming specs/wireframes
linking/          INBOX.md, shared contracts
```

Report any folders created.

### L1-B: Root File Audit

Check each required root file. Create from template if missing:

| File | If Missing | Health Check |
|---|---|---|
| `TASKS.md` | Create empty template | Task Sync (L1-D) |
| `BUGS.md` | Create empty template | Bug Sync (L1-D) |
| `PLAN.md` | Create empty template | Has `## Current Focus`? |
| `FEATURES.md` | Create empty template | Has `## PRD Index` table? |
| `PROJECT.md` | Create empty template | Goals Check (L1-D) |
| `CONSTRAINTS.md` | Create header-only stub | Has `## Architectural Constraints`? |
| `SUBSYSTEMS.md` | Create empty template | Subsystem Sync (L1-D) |
| `IDEA_BOARD.md` | Create empty template | Has `## Active Ideas`? |

### L1-C: .identity Integrity

Verify all fields present and valid:
```ini
project_id=     ← UUID format — STOP if missing, invoke g-setup
project_name=   ← warn if doesn't match parent folder name
user_id=        ← fill with "unknown" if missing
user_name=      ← fill with "unknown" if missing
galdr_version=  ← semver format
vault_location= ← fill with "{LOCAL}" if missing
```

### L1-D: Task / Bug / Feature / Subsystem Sync

- **Tasks**: activate `g-tasks → SYNC CHECK`. Auto-fix status mismatches (file is source of truth). Report phantoms/orphans.
- **Bugs**: for each BUGS.md row: check `bugs/bugNNN_*.md` exists. Missing → PHANTOM ⚠️
- **Features**: same phantom/orphan pattern.
- **Subsystems**: activate `g-subsystems → SYNC CHECK`. Add stub entries for subsystems referenced in tasks but missing from registry.

### L1-E: Sequential ID Integrity

- Tasks: find ID gaps, duplicates, out-of-order entries → report; offer auto-renumber (requires `--apply`)
- Bugs: same
- Features: same

### L1-F: YAML Frontmatter Validation

For each `tasks/*.md`, `bugs/*.md`, `features/*.md`:
- Malformed YAML (fails to parse) → report as critical
- Missing required fields → add with defaults silently
- Status normalization: `in_progress` → `in-progress`

### L1-G: Empty Stub Detection

Tasks or bugs with no `## Objective` or `## Acceptance Criteria` → flag as incomplete stub

### L1-H: BOM / Encoding Audit

Check for BOM (`\xef\xbb\xbf`) at file start in any `.galdr/**/*.md` → report; remove with `--apply`

### L1-I: Version Bump (UPGRADE mode only, after apply confirmed)

Write new `galdr_version` to `.galdr/.identity`. Append to `.galdr/reports/UPGRADE_LOG.md`.

### L1-J: Maintenance Routines (ALL modes)

- **TTL Check**: for each `in-progress` task: `now > claim_expires_at`? → reset to `pending`
- **Verification Timeout**: `[🔍]` for > 8h → reset to `pending`; > 4h → flag only
- **Health Score**:
  ```
  base  = (completed / total_non_cancelled) × 100
  -5    per stale [🔄]
  -3    per [🔍] > 4h
  -10   per task with failure_history > 2
  -15   per subsystem with no tasks ever
  final = max(0, base − penalties)
  Healthy: ≥80 | Degraded: 50-79 | Critical: <50
  ```
- **ACTIVE_BACKLOG.md Regeneration**: write `.galdr/ACTIVE_BACKLOG.md`
- **Platform Parity Audit**: compare `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/rules/`, `.agent/rules/` — report violations (see `PARITY_EXCLUDES.md`)
- **Placeholder Sweep**: scan `.galdr/**/*.md` for `{project_name}`, `{Goal name}`, `YYYY-MM-DD` (literal) — auto-fill `{project_name}` from `.identity`; report rest

### L1 Output

Brief console summary:
```
🩺 g-medic L1 — {project_name} | TRIAGE complete
   ✅ tasks/  ✅ bugs/  ⚠️ features/ CREATED
   Tasks synced: 42  |  Bugs synced: 8  |  0 phantoms
   Health score: 87/100  |  TTL resets: 0
   Report: .galdr/reports/{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}_MEDIC_L1.md
```

---

## Level 2 — Diagnosis (Plan Coherence)

*Requires human review before applying. Blast radius: .galdr/ data.*
*Run with `--level 2`. Generates `MEDIC_REPORT_L2.md`. Use `--apply` to execute fixes.*

### L2-A: PLAN.md vs TASKS.md Coherence

- Milestones listed as complete in PLAN.md: verify all associated tasks are `[✅]`
- Milestones with no associated tasks: flag
- Tasks in TASKS.md with no milestone parent: flag if >30 days old

### L2-B: Task Dependency DAG Validation

```
□ Circular dependencies (A depends B; B depends A) → CRITICAL flag
□ Dependency on non-existent task ID → ERROR flag
□ Dependency on cancelled/failed task → WARNING flag
□ Tasks blocked > 14 days on unresolved dependency → surface in report
```

### L2-C: Interface Compatibility Check

For tasks with `output_format:` or `input_format:` fields:
- "Task A says it outputs X format; Task B expects Y format — incompatible" → flag

### L2-D: Complexity Audit

Tasks with >8 acceptance criteria OR >3 subsystems: suggest subtask split (write as proposed blocks in report — NOT auto-created)

### L2-E: Feature ↔ Task Linkage

- Features with `status: specced` or `status: committed` but no linked task → flag: "orphaned feature spec"
- Tasks with no feature back-reference AND >2 ACs → flag: "implementation without spec"

### L2-F: SUBSYSTEMS.md ↔ subsystems/ Completeness

- SUBSYSTEMS.md entry with no `subsystems/{name}.md` file → offer to create stub
- `subsystems/*.md` files with missing `locations:` frontmatter → flag incomplete

### L2-G: Missing Cross-Project Ref

Tasks that span >1 subsystem AND those subsystems are owned by different projects (per `capabilities.md`) but have no `cross_project_ref:` → flag: "may need cross-project routing"

### L2-H: Creates Missing Stubs

With `--apply`:
- Creates missing `tasks/taskNNN_*.md` for TASKS.md entries that have no file
- Creates missing `features/featNNN_*.md` for FEATURES.md entries that have no file
- Each created file is a minimal stub with YAML frontmatter + `## Objective` placeholder

### L2 Output

Write `MEDIC_REPORT_L2.md` to `.galdr/reports/`:
```markdown
# g-medic L2 Diagnosis Report
**Project**: {name} | **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Critical Findings
- [ ] CIRCULAR DEP: Task 42 ↔ Task 43

## Warnings
- [ ] PLAN coherence: Milestone "M3: Auth" shows complete but Task 17 is still pending

## Suggestions
- [ ] Task 95: 11 ACs — consider splitting into 2-3 sub-tasks

## Stubs Created (--apply)
- tasks/task099_placeholder.md
```

---

## Level 3 — Surgery (Cross-Subsystem Interface Audit)

*Requires explicit `--apply` flag. Blast radius: subsystems + schema contracts.*
*Run with `--level 3 --apply`. Generates `MEDIC_REPORT_L3.md`.*

### L3-A: Cross-Subsystem Data Flow Audit

For each pair of subsystems (A writes → B reads):
1. Find all skills/tasks where A produces output consumed by B
2. Compare output format in A's skill/task spec against expected input format in B's skill/task spec
3. Format mismatch → flag as interface violation

### L3-B: Skill Logic Chain Validation

- SKILL.md operations referenced by commands (e.g., `g-task-add` triggers `g-skl-tasks → CREATE`) → verify operation name matches
- Dead references: command references operation that no longer exists in skill → ERROR

### L3-C: Capabilities Gap Detection

- Tasks/features reference a capability (e.g., "vector search", "OAuth") that no subsystem in `capabilities.md` declares as `status: ready`
- Output: `"Capability gap: vector-search — no subsystem owns this in ready state"`

### L3-D: CONSTRAINTS.md Violation Check

For each active constraint in `CONSTRAINTS.md`:
- Scan task/feature specs for planned work that would violate the constraint
- Flag violating tasks with: `"⚠️ Constraint C-{id} violation: {title}"`

### L3-E: Activity Log Audit

Tasks marked `[✅]` that have NOT appended to any subsystem Activity Log in `subsystems/*.md`:
- Flag: "Task {id} completed but subsystem activity log not updated"

### L3-F: Creates / Annotates

With `--apply`:
- Creates missing subsystem spec files for subsystems referenced in tasks but absent from `subsystems/`
- Adds missing capability entries to `capabilities.md` based on subsystem references
- Annotates interface mismatches directly in affected SKILL.md files with:
  ```
  <!-- BUG[MEDIC-L3]: Interface mismatch — A outputs {format}; B expects {format} -->
  ```

### L3 Output

Write `MEDIC_REPORT_L3.md` to `.galdr/reports/` with full findings + remediation plan.

---

## Level 4 — Ecosystem (Linked Projects)

*Requires PCAC topology (T117). Requires `--level 4` or `--ecosystem` flag + human approval per project.*
*Blast radius: linked projects.*
*Falls back gracefully if no topology: prints "L4 requires linked projects — run @g-pcac-adopt first"*

### L4-A: Peer Capability Readiness

- Load `.galdr/linking/peers/*_capabilities.md`
- Find features/tasks this project depends on that a peer hasn't marked `ready`
- Flag: `"Blocked dependency: {this_task} waits on {peer_slug}:{capability} (status: {status})"`

### L4-B: Cross-Project Constraint Conflicts

- Load peer capability snapshots
- Compare each peer's known constraints against this project's constraints
- Contradictions (Peer A: "no Docker"; this project: "requires Docker for adv tier") → flag

### L4-C: Cross-Project Feature Contract Validation

- Find features with `cross_project_ref:` slug
- For each: check peer's version of the same feature (via PCAC INFO or snapshot)
- Spec contradictions → flag: "Feature contract mismatch: {slug} — {this_project} spec vs {peer_slug} spec differ"

### L4-D: Stale Peer Snapshots

- Peer capabilities last synced > N days ago (default 7) → flag: "Stale peer snapshot: {peer_slug} (last sync: {date})"

### L4-E: Long-Blocked Cross-Project Tasks

- Tasks with `cross_project_ref` blocked on peer completion for > 14 days → surface for human escalation

### L4-F: Suggests PCAC Actions

For each finding, generate a suggested PCAC coordination message (does NOT send without explicit per-message human approval):
```
Suggested: [SYNC] to galdr_valhalla — request capability status update for "vector-search"
  → Run: @g-pcac-notify galdr_valhalla "Requesting capability status update for vector-search"
  Approve? [y/n]
```

### L4 Output

Write `MEDIC_REPORT_L4.md` to `.galdr/reports/` (one per affected peer + consolidated ecosystem health score).

```
🌐 Ecosystem Health Score: 72/100 (Degraded)
  galdr_valhalla:  3 stale capabilities  |  1 contract mismatch
  galdr_frontend:  snapshot 12d old  |  2 blocked deps > 14d
```
