# Cloud GPU Training

Run ML training jobs on rented cloud GPUs when local hardware is too slow or would block the developer's machine for too long.

## When to Use

- Training run would take >24 hours locally
- User wants to keep local GPU free for other work
- Model fits in cloud GPU memory (A100 80GB or H100 80GB)
- The data being uploaded is not highly sensitive IP

## Quick Reference

### Providers (March 2026 pricing)

| Provider | A100 80GB | H100 SXM | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Lambda Labs | $1.29/hr | $2.89/hr | ML-focused, simple |
| RunPod | $1.39/hr | $2.69/hr | Good UI, reliable |
| Vast.ai | $1.89/hr | $1.87/hr | Cheapest H100 |

### Security Rules

1. NEVER upload .env, API keys, credentials, or secrets
2. NEVER upload patent-protected algorithms or proprietary encoding schemes
3. Use SCP (SSH) for all file transfers — never plain HTTP
4. Delete instances immediately after downloading results
5. Review all files before upload — check for hardcoded secrets in comments

### Batch Size Scaling Guide

| GPU | VRAM | Typical batch_size | gradient_accumulation |
|-----|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| RTX 4090 | 24 GB | 4-16 | 16-4 |
| A100 80GB | 80 GB | 64-128 | 1 |
| H100 80GB | 80 GB | 64-128 | 1 |

Effective batch = batch_size × gradient_accumulation. Keep effective batch ~64.

### Workflow

1. Prepare upload bundle (training script + data + model code)
2. Create cloud instance (PyTorch template)
3. Upload via SCP
4. SSH in, verify files, launch training in tmux/screen
5. Monitor progress via logs
6. Download results (checkpoints + logs)
7. Terminate instance immediately
8. Log cost in `.galdr/logs/cloud_costs.json`

### Estimating Cost

```
cost = (local_epoch_hours / speedup_factor) × num_epochs × provider_rate
```

- A100 speedup vs RTX 4090: ~6-8x (mainly from larger batch size)
- H100 speedup vs RTX 4090: ~10-12x

### Tips

- Always use `tmux` or `screen` on the remote instance so training survives SSH disconnects
- Download checkpoints incrementally (don't wait until the end)
- Set up monitoring early — `nvidia-smi -l 5` in a separate tmux pane
