## How to Install

```powershell
# Install a pack into the current project
.\skill_packs\infrastructure\install.ps1

# Install into a specific project
.\skill_packs\infrastructure\install.ps1 -ProjectRoot "C:\my-project"
```

After install, restart your IDE to load the new skills.

## How to Uninstall

Delete the skill directories listed in the pack's `PACK.md` under **FILES**.

## Design Principles

- **Inert at rest** — skill_packs/ does not auto-load. Skills deploy only when you run `install.ps1`.
- **No loader hacks** — files copy into standard IDE skill paths (`.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, etc.)
- **5 IDE targets** — each pack deploys to `.cursor`, `.claude`, `.agent`, `.codex`, `.opencode`
- **No default galdr pollution** — none of these are included in the base install

## Adding a New Pack

1. Create `skill_packs/{pack-name}/` with `PACK.md`, `install.ps1`, and `files/`
2. Populate `files/` with the 5 IDE target directories and SKILL.md files
3. Add a row to this README
