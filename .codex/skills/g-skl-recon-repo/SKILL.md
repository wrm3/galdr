name: g-skl-recon-repo
description: Capture a GitHub repository into the vault as a structured summary note. Produces research/repos/ notes and _index.yaml. Optional --deep flag triggers full g-skl-res-deep analysis pass.
---
# g-recon-repo

**Activate for**: "capture this repo", "save repo to vault", "summarize this GitHub project", "recon repo", "add repository to knowledge base", `@g-recon-repo`

---

## Purpose

Quickly capture a GitHub repository as an Obsidian-compatible vault note in `research/repos/`. Unlike `g-skl-res-deep` (which runs a full 5-pass analysis), this skill produces a lightweight summary note optimized for vault browsing and quick reference.

Optionally, pass `--deep` to run `g-skl-res-deep` after capture and produce a full recon report in `vault/research/recon/{slug}/`.

---

## Operation: CAPTURE

```
@g-recon-repo https://github.com/owner/repo
@g-recon-repo https://github.com/owner/repo --deep
@g-recon-repo https://github.com/owner/repo --title "Custom Title" --topics "ai,agents"
```

### Steps

1. **Read key files**: README.md, package.json / pyproject.toml / Cargo.toml / go.mod, LICENSE, primary source files (max 20)
2. **Extract**: purpose, tech stack, architecture, notable patterns, license, activity level
3. **Write vault note** to `research/repos/{owner}__{repo}.md` with Obsidian frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "{repo title}"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   type: repo_capture
   ingestion_type: manual
   source: https://github.com/owner/repo
   topics: [inferred]
   tags: [repo, {language}, {domain}]
   owner: owner
   repo: repo
   license: MIT / Apache-2.0 / etc
   stars: N (if available)
   ---
   ```
4. **Register** in `research/repos/_index.yaml`
5. **Append** to `vault/log.md` per C-006
6. **If --deep**: activate `g-skl-res-deep ANALYZE` on the captured repo

### Dedup check

- Check `research/repos/_index.yaml` for existing entry with same `source`
- If found and age < 30 days → skip unless `--force`
- If found and age ≥ 30 days → re-capture (update existing note in-place)
