description: YouTube transcript ingestion into the vault. Uses yt-dlp to fetch transcripts locally — no Docker, no MCP, no screen captures. Stores in research/videos/ with analysis_depth=transcript_only for future vision upgrade.

# g-ingest-youtube

**Scripts**: `.cursor/skills/g-skl-ingest-youtube/scripts/`

**Activate for**: "ingest this YouTube video", "capture transcript", "add video to vault", "save YouTube notes", any YouTube URL.

---

## Purpose

Capture YouTube video transcripts into the vault's `research/videos/` folder using **yt-dlp** — a local command-line tool with no Docker or MCP requirement. Notes are stored as `analysis_depth: transcript_only` which signals a future task can upgrade them to full vision analysis when the MCP video analyzer is available.

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
# or
uv pip install yt-dlp
```

Verify: `yt-dlp --version`

---

## Operation: INGEST_YOUTUBE

Capture a YouTube video transcript and create a vault note.

```bash
python .cursor/skills/g-skl-ingest-youtube/scripts/fetch_transcript.py \
  --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" \
  --vault-path /path/to/vault
```

**What happens:**
1. Run `yt-dlp --dump-json` to get metadata (title, channel, duration, upload date)
2. Run `yt-dlp --write-auto-sub --skip-download --sub-format vtt` to fetch captions
3. Parse VTT → clean text (strip timestamps, deduplicate rolling captions)
4. Generate 2–3 sentence summary and key-points list from transcript
5. Write vault note to `research/videos/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{slugified-title}.md`
6. Append to `vault/log.md`
7. Add entry to `vault/_index.yaml`
8. Run `g-hk-vault-reindex.ps1` (if available)

**Output note path**: `{vault_root}/research/videos/{date}_{slug}.md`

---

## Operation: CHECK_SETUP

Verify yt-dlp is installed and working.

```bash
python .cursor/skills/g-skl-ingest-youtube/scripts/fetch_transcript.py --check-setup
```

Reports: yt-dlp version + a simple test that the binary is accessible.

## Caption Source Priority

| Priority | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Manually uploaded captions (`en`) | Most accurate |
| 2 | Auto-generated captions (`en`) | Usually good for clear speech |
| 3 | Auto-translated to English | Fallback for non-English videos |
| 4 | No captions available | Metadata-only note with warning |

## Vault Note Schema

```yaml
---
date: 2026-04-06
type: video
ingestion_type: one_shot
source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
title: "Video Title"
channel: "Channel Name"
published: "2026-01-15"
duration_minutes: 42
tags: [video]
refresh_policy: manual
source_volatility: snapshot
analysis_depth: transcript_only
source_notes: "Transcript captured 2026-04-06. No visual analysis."
---

## Summary
{2–3 sentence AI-generated summary from transcript}

## Key Points
- {Point 1}
- {Point 2}
- {Point N}

## Full Transcript
{clean transcript text, timestamps removed}
```

---

## Not In Scope

- No video download (no storage cost)
- No frame extraction or visual analysis (future upgrade via `analysis_depth` field)
- No scheduled re-ingestion — these are one-shot captures
